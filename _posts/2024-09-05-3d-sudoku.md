This all started when I was looking for new kinds of puzzles for Mads FÃ¸k, thr students magazine at Natural Sciences at Aarhus University.
I was talking to some friends waiting for the revue, when we started talking about
puzzles in higher dimensions. Eventually we got to sudokus, and I got to thinking,
that a 3-dimensional sudoku might be possible. So Magnus, Natascha, Victor and Jonas,
if you read this: thank you very much for the inspiration.
